        <h1>You should learn Python!</h1>
        <img src="img/python.png" alt="Python logo">
        <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language. It has played an important part in data science, machine learning, and web development. Python’s documentation library covers how to visualize and compile large quantities of data using Matplotlib, Pandas, and more. People have also used it to program desktop applications.
        Python has a low barrier to entry. It’s simple but elegant, with many real-world applications — one notable example being artificial intelligence. As seen in web scraping, Python has the capability to extract a large amount of data.</p>

      <div id="javaScript">
        <h1>You should learn JavaScript!</h1>
        <img src="img/js.png" alt="javaScript logo">
        <p>A dynamic programming language, JavaScript is used primarily in web development to design interactive, user-friendly websites. It provides stylized web pages with added functionality and allows brands to increase their user engagement by displaying animated elements on their websites.
        This versatile programming language is the core component of web browsers and is suitable for most beginners who are curious about front-end web development or mobile game development.</p>

      <div id="cSharp">
        <h1>You should learn C#!</h1>
        <img src="img/cSharp.png" alt="cSharp logo">
        <p>C# is Microsoft’s programming language. Being one of the most popular languages, it has since been adopted into the Windows, Linux, and iOS and Android platforms. C# is also known for having a huge collection of libraries and frameworks.
        It is often the language of choice for game developers and mobile app creators, though it has also been implemented in enterprise software like Azure and IoT. If you’re interested in game design, you’ll most likely encounter C# when building assets in the Unity engine for a new game.</p>
